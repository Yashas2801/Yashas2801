## ðŸŒŸ Open-Source Vision
My main interest lies in making **VLSI** related resources open source. The VLSI industry often operates on a more closed level, which I believe slows down technological advancements in this field. I aspire to be a key contributor to open-source efforts in VLSI, fostering innovation and accessibility for the next generation of engineers.
